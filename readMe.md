### Although you defined the VolumeSize of the machine correctly, the t2.medium instance type is not suitable for this project. Why you defined t2.medium instance type rather than t3.small or better? 
"You'll need two vCPUs and at least 4GB of RAM": this was taken from the project description. I see only medium instance types having 4GB of RAM.
